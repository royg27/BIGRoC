> **Abstract:** *The interest of the machine learning community in image synthesis has grown significantly in recent years, with the introduction of a wide range of deep generative models and means for training them.
In this work, we propose a general model-agnostic technique for improving the image quality and the distribution fidelity of generated images, obtained by any generative model.
Our method, termed BIGRoC (Boosting Image Generation via a Robust Classifier), is based on a post-processing procedure via the guidance of a given robust classifier and without a need for additional training of the generative model.
Given a synthesized image, we propose to update it through projected gradient steps over the robust classifier, in an attempt to refine its recognition.
We demonstrate this post-processing algorithm on various image synthesis methods and show a significant improvement of the generated images, both quantitatively and qualitatively, on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.
Specifically, BIGRoC improves the image synthesis state of the art on ImageNet 128x128 by 14.81%, attaining an FID score of 2.53 and on 256x256 by 7.87%, achieving an FID of 3.63.*
